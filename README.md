This project represents my puttering around with entropy sources and
random number generation in Linux/GNU. Much of the testing was done using
the TrueRNG USB hardware entropy generator (which works quite well),
and the NIST Python-based test suite, on an Ubuntu-based Dell server,
and on a Raspian-based Raspberry Pi B 2 v1.1.

Many thanks to my friend, occasional colleague, former office mate, and
mentor REDACTED, who has a wealth of deep expertise in this domain.
